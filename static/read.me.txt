Hello thank you for selecting my game.

I realise my input method isnt the same as other students so im putting this here to let you know how it works
The game will ask you for your name initially.
After this the random word will be displayed and player will be asked for a guess


The player can only input one input ONE word at a time.

The system will display the current guesses if the word is valid.
If not an appropriate error message will be displayed.
